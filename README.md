# Defense
Enabling protection against superior force
All these are meant to be non-lethal and mostly harmless. If any harm should come from their use its because the attack you defended against was lethal in nature. Thus morality is intact.
//Work in progresss

1. WarDrobe: Techsuit of HarmOr. 
  Funtions: Defense firstly. Only offensive is causing incoming threats to return to sender...
  - Stacks of re-beaconing creditcard-sized Quaffle (named after JK Rowlings stories) which confuses the incoming armaments to go swap target with coordinates it came from. (if telemetry)
  -	Beiskaldi: Frpom Norse "Gripe bitch", where "Gripe=Rella"
  - Sveit: Ejectable virtual reinforcements that utilizes (groundstructure dependant) Voronoi structures in which they inject harmonic ressonances to induce worbling tremors. Confusing radar and limiting all groundtroop movements.
  - nári: Similar to Sveit but this induces lowfrequency sickening tremors tuned to the average harmonic ressonance of a human colon. With obvious results.. Those fellas arent running towards you anymore LOL. From Norse "Groin".
  - Ymr: Also similar to Sveit. These ones ressonate to induce blackening tinnitus in the ears and worble eyeballs. Results are completely unable to see or hear.
  - Glotta: Cloud enemy LiDar, Radar and digital visuals with your own position. Kinda like a Berserkerbeacon. From norse "glotta við tǫn - grin contemptuously (showing the teeth)".
  - Herfiligr : Sending incoming back to sender. From Norse "bitter, wretched, shameful, harsh (adj)". If without telemetry
 //TODO: Make less harmful beorfre relaelsler-/
//Fjölkyngi: ... From norse "black magic"n /
